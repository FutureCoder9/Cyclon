## Backup
Issue Encountered while trying to backup Container created initially . 
ERROR received : No volumes are currently mounted to the Docker container, which is why the /backup/rman_backups directory doesn't exist inside the container, preventing RMAN from creating backup files.
Root Cause:
The container was created without any volume mounts.


Steps to Fix the Issues:
1.	Commit the Existing Container to a New Image:
•	Use the following command to create a new image that preserves your Cyclon project:
docker commit <container_id> oracle_cyclon_image

•	Replace <container_id> with the actual ID of your oracle-container.

2.	Stop the Existing Container:
•	Stop the original container using:
docker stop <container_id>

3.	Remove the Existing Container:
•	Remove the old container with:

docker rm <container_id>
4.	Create a New Container with Volume Mount:
•	Run a new container from the image you just created, including the volume mount:
docker run -d \
  -p 1521:1521 \
  -v C:\data\oracle_backups:/backup/rman_backups \
  --name oracle_cyclon_container \
  oracle_cyclon_image

5.	Verify the Setup:

•	Connect to the new container:
docker exec -it oracle_cyclon_container bash
•	Check if the volume mount is correctly set up:
•	
ls -l /backup/rman_backups  

ACTUAL BACKUP : 

6.	Configure RMAN for Backups:
•	Connect to RMAN:
rman target /
•	Set up control file autobackup format:
sql
CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT FOR DEVICE TYPE DISK TO '/backup/rman_backups/%F';
CONFIGURE CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP ON;
•	Run a test backup:
sql
BACKUP DATABASE PLUS ARCHIVELOG;
7.	Monitor Backup Location:
•	Verify that backup files are created in C:\data\oracle_backups on your host machine.
8.	Performance Tuning (Optional):
•	After backups are set up, consider performance tuning using RMAN techniques, such as enabling parallelism and adjusting redo log sizes.
